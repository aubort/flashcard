# French Flashcards (Prototype)

A simple, gamified web application designed for first grade students to learn the top 100 most common French words.

## Features
- **Flashcards**: Interactive cards with French words.
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Uses system text-to-speech to pronounce words.
- **Voice Selection**: Choose the best available French voice on your device.
- **Gamification**: Visual rewards (confetti, stars) and level progression.

## Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Status
**Prototype Phase**: This is an early prototype. It uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API for audio, so quality depends on the user's operating system. Future versions may integrate high-quality AI voices.
